                <li>Is osu! safe?</li>
                <p>Yes osu! is safe. If ever you feel like verifying the safety of a file, feel free to run it through a virus scan.</p>
                <li>Are your methods safe?</li>
                <p>I try my best to research fixes and attempt them in a virtual environment first before ever telling someone to do them. Any software that I recommend will be from official sources or will be open-sourced.</p>
                <li>Where can I find all the videos for the tutorials that you have posted?</li>
                <p>All of my tutorial videos will be posted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMF1_5rZqms3b51ImGDmv5Fhr4ZKo2czz"> Youtube Playlist</a> that is updated whenever there is a new post on this site.</p>
